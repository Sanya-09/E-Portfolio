            Hi, I'm ,<b>Sanya Agarwal</b>Sanya Agarwal, a pre-final year B.Tech Computer Science (Data Science) student at UPES with a strong foundation in software development, data analysis, and problem-solving.

I enjoy working on real-world problems by combining technical skills, analytical thinking, and user-focused design to build effective solutions. My experience spans software development, data-driven projects, and collaborative work with diverse teams.

Through academic projects, internships, and independent work, I’ve gained hands-on exposure to programming, system design basics, data analysis, and building end-to-end applications. I’m comfortable working across different domains, adapting quickly, and learning new technologies as needed.

As I work toward graduation in 2027, I’m actively seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully, learn from real-world challenges, and grow as a versatile technology professional.

I’m always open to connecting with teams looking for a motivated, adaptable intern across software, data, AI, or product-focused roles.  </p>
